Most people can be categorized into one of the following levels based on the mechanism through which they spend money.

**Level 0:** Only using cash/debit card. This is significantly worse than using a credit card, as you lose many of the valuable benefits of using a credit card (building credit, fraud protection, etc.). However, it's plausible that this is the optimal point for those who struggle with keeping track of finances/remembering to make payments/spending responsibly.

**Level 1:** Only using a single credit card, usually one with no annual fee and very little cashback (1-1.5%), likely issued by the individual's primary bank. This is much better than not having a credit card, but far from optimal, due to the low cashback/lack of benefits on the credit card. Most people fall into this category.

**Level 2:** Only using a single credit card, but one that was chosen with some amount of thought. Maybe this card has no annual fee but comparatively high cashback (2-2.5%), or maybe the card has an annual fee but comes with high cashback in useful categories (dining, travel) and other nice perks (travel insurance, lounge access, travel/food credits). This is an improvement over level 1, but not a large one.

**Level 3 (?):** Using multiple category-based cashback credit cards. This is theoretically better than level 2 (e.g. it's possible to craft some portfolio of credit cards such that you're able to get ~5% back on the majority of expenses) but I personally find it less optimal, since every time you make a purchase you have to think about which of your 10 credit cards you should use (also, you have to bring all your cards with you everywhere, for the places that don't take Apple Pay).

**Level 4:** Continuously applying for new cards to collect their signup bonuses after meeting the minimum spend requirement. The return on capital here is extremely high (e.g. >10% back). There is some startup cost here, since banks have rules in place to prevent inidividuals from egregiously taking advantage of these signup bonuses, and it's important to understand these rules when starting out. There is also some work involved with keeping track of bonuses/annual fees, filling out credit card applications, etc. but it's not large as long as you're reasonably organized.

**Level 5:** This is level 4, but fully optimized using a variety of strategies. Most individuals in this level are limited in their returns not by the amount of money they are able to "spend", but by the amount of cards that banks will let them apply for. 

This guide focuses on level 4/5.
