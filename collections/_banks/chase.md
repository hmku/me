* Minimum time between SUBs: 24 months (48 months between any Sapphire cards)
* Difficulty of obtaining business cards: moderate

#### rules
**5/24** Probably the most restrictive of all anti-churning rules. You can only be approved for a Chase card if you have been approved for less than 5 personal cards (from any issuer) in the past 24 months.

**1/90** Regularly applying for >1 card every 90 days will put you at risk of shutdown (but doing this once in a while is fine).

#### general tips
* You can only refer people for your card family (e.g. Freedom, United MileagePlus)
* Chase will not approve you for a card if your total credit limit across all cards exceeds half your salary.
* Chase will prorate your annual fee if you cancel in the middle of a cardmember year.
* Chase rarely/never claws back SUBs for returns/MS.

#### best redemptions
* PYB for 1.5cpp
* Transfer to Hyatt for >2cpp
