#### rules
**5/24** Probably the most restrictive of all anti-churning rules. You can only be approved for a Chase card if you have been approved for less than 5 personal cards (from any issuer) in the past 24 months.

**2/30** Chase will often deny the 3rd personal card application within 30 days.

**1/30** Chase will often deny the 2nd business card application within 30 days.

**1/90** Regularly applying for >1 card every 90 days will put you at risk of shutdown (but doing this once in a while is fine).

#### cards
**CSR/CSP** The Sapphire Reserve and Sapphire Preferred are Chase's flagship luxury cards. These come with a large SUB and many useful benefits.
