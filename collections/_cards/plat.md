#### general tips
* Optimal time to apply is in late November/December, since credits are per calendar year
    * This allows you to "triple dip" the annual credits while only paying one AF
    * e.g. receive card 12/15/22, close card 1/10/24, you get $600 airline fee credits
* Airline fee credit can be used for regular flights
    * Easiest method is to reload United travelbank
    * Other loopholes: JetBlue flights under ~$120, Southwest flights under ~$100, Delta flights that are partially paid with GC
* Hilton gold status can be matched to elite status with every car rental agency
    * Match Hilton gold -> National Emerald Club Executive Elite -> Hertz President's Circle -> Avis Preferred Plus
* Travel insurance is subpar compared to CSR
    * Only applicable on round-trip travel booked with card
    * Only secondary rental car insurance (will not apply if you have a primary auto insurance policy)
* Clear credit can be used for two people ($119 + $60 for second family member)
    * Stack with Clear signup offers (in the past there has been $75 Uber credit, $100 travelbank)
