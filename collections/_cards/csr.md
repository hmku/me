#### general tips
* After first year AF posts, use the next year's $300 travel credit by booking/cancelling a refundable flight before downgrading/cancelling the card (Chase doesn't claw back the travel credit when you get a refund)
* CSR has better travel insurance than almost every other card (primary rental car insurance, no round-trip flight requirement)
    * For award flights, using CSR to pay for fees insures the trip (even if the fees are trivial)
