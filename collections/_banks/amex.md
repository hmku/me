* Minimum time between SUBs: ~7 years
* Difficulty of obtaining business cards: easy

#### rules
* forgot what these are honestly

#### general tips
* Co-branded cards can only refer within the same family, but charge cards can refer any card
* Be careful with MS for meeting a SUB (Amex will clawback SUB for MS/returns)
* Add every Amex offer to your card, most are useless but some are valuable
    * Every card has a limit of 100 unadded offers, but no limit to added offers, so it's optimal to add every offer to keep seeing new offers
* Amex will often give targeted bonuses (20k MR) for enrolling in Pay Over Time, so make sure your cards are unenrolled
* Amex will often give bonuses for adding AUs/employee cards and spending on those cards (e.g. 20k MR/$4k spend)
    * Spend on AUs/employee cards count towards MSR, so can double dip employee card bonuses with SUBs
    * Employee cards come pre-activated, so if you never register them you don't have to provide SSN (Amex will auto-close after 2mo though)
* Amex often provides retention offers for keeping their premium cards (Plat/Biz Plat)
    * Always call Amex when AF posts and ask for a retention offer

#### best redemptions
* Book Star Alliance flights using ANA/Aeroplan/LifeMiles
* Booking Air France/KLM with Flying Blue can be a good redemption
* Hilton during 30% transfer bonus is not bad
