I spent a week and a half traveling in Australia and New Zealand from P2’s end of school year to Memorial Day. This was my first time and P2’s second time in Oceania.

## Flights

EWR-LAX, B6 Y: 11k JB miles + $5.60

LAX-SYD, QF F: 160k QFF (transferred from MR) + fees

SYD-CNS, CNS-AKL-CHC, ZQN-AKL: cash

AKL-IAH, NZ J: 62.5k VS (transferred from MR) + $45.80

IAH-EWR, UA Y: travelbank

I booked the outbound flight in fall 2023 when Qantas released a batch of NA-Oceania award space. The flight was expensive, but Qantas F is an aspirational redemption, and I was flush in MR back then (rip). I probably would not spend this much on a single flight again. For the return flight, I had SYD-DFW booked in QF J for 126k QFF + fees (?!), but I was alerted to AKL-IAH in NZ J opening up via seats.aero around 1 month before the trip, so I quickly switched my reservation. As far as I'm aware, NZ J is not easy to book, and this flight was both cheaper and fit our itinerary better, so I was pretty happy about this redemption.

### Qantas F (8.5/10)

The Qantas first class lounge in LAX had a restaurant with a reasonably sized menu where you could order dishes like tteokboki and salt and pepper squid. I thought the food was not bad, definitely better than airplane food. I skipped the dinner service on the plane, and thought the breakfast (eggs + smoked salmon) was not great, which was a bit disappointing for my first F redemption. On the bright side, the seats were extremely spacious (everyone had their own mini-suite, and there was space to stand up and walk around), and the bed was very comfortable. I was able to get >8 hours of sleep.

### Air New Zealand J (8/10)

I liked the NZ J lounge in AKL - it was very spacious and the food was good (there was someone grilling fresh scallops on order). NZ J was your standard lie-flat 1-2-1 configuration on a 777, and although it was nothing special, it’s hard to complain when paying 62.5k VS.  I will say that the seat was a bit narrow (not an issue for me), and I was a bit sad that there wasn’t wifi on our flight.

### Short-haul flights

For the flights in Oceania, we flew some combination of Jetstar and Air NZ. The only thing worth mentioning here is that, as far as I could tell, Air NZ flight prices only increase, so it’s good to book early. (I did not book as early as I should have.)

## Hotels

Park Hyatt Sydney: 20k + $250/night (points rate was 40k/night)

Port Douglas Motel: $100/night (Delta stays credit)

Chateau on the Park, Doubletree Christchurch: $120/night (HH biz credit)

Aoraki Court Motel: $200/night (Delta stays credit)

Edgewater (Wanaka): $150/night (Delta stays credit)

Hilton Queenstown Resort & Spa: $120/night (HH biz credit)

Park Hyatt Auckland: $240/night (points rate was 20k/night)

This trip was a good opportunity to use up some annoying credits and also check out some aspirational Hyatts as a Globalist.

### Park Hyatt Sydney (7/10)

The PH Sydney is located near Circular Quay, directly across the harbor from the opera house. As globalists, we were upgraded to a room with a harbor/opera house view from the balcony, and the view was definitely my favorite thing about the stay. Waking up and seeing the opera house over the water from the window was a great experience. The room and bed were comfortable, and the hotel had standard Le Labo amenities, which P2 enjoyed.

With that being said, the hotel was a bit dated, there were mosquitoes (!) in the bathroom, the breakfast was mediocre, and I didn’t like that the nearest train station (Circular Quay) was a >10 minute walk away (although it was a nice walk by the harbor). Overall, for one of the most celebrated Category 8’s in Hyatt’s portfolio, I was a bit disappointed.

### Park Hyatt Auckland (9.5/10)

In contrast, the PH Auckland greatly exceeded my expectations. Like the PH Sydney, the hotel overlooks the harbor, with a view of the city skyline. As globalist, we were upgraded to a deluxe king room with rooftop balcony, and it was one of my favorite rooms that I’ve stayed in, second only to the ocean view suite at the Grand Hyatt Kauai. The room was extremely spacious, with a large balcony, a walk-in closet, a separate bathroom and toilet room, and a comfortable sitting area. The bathroom had both a large shower (again, with the standard Le Labo amenities) and a large bathtub in front of a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the harbor I also really liked the design of the room (and of the hotel in general) - everything was very clean and modern, with warm wooden accents.

The hotel also featured a “hydrotherapy” room with a large jacuzzi, a plunge pool, a steam room, and a sauna, which P2 and I enjoyed very much. The breakfast was fully covered due to the Globalist benefit, and I ordered a breakfast fried rice and some smoked salmon, both of which I thought were extremely good. I was especially impressed by the fried rice, which definitely exceeded my expectations for how good fried rice could be.

### Other hotels

The Port Douglas Motel was nothing fancy, but it was cheap and comfortable, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone staying in the area.

Chateau in the Park was a very standard Doubletree - I probably would not have stayed if I wasn’t trying to use up my quarterly credit from the HH biz.

Aoraki Court Motel was one of the few options for staying within Mt Cook National Park, and the room was pretty barebones, but it was comfortable and I would stay there again.

Edgewater was a pretty dated resort, and I didn’t like that we had to walk up a flight of stairs to get to our room. We had a lake view, but it wasn’t anything special. Overall I would probably skip staying a night in Wanaka, the entire town feels very tourist trap-y. They had freshly baked scones for breakfast, and those were good (you have to pay for those though).

The Hilton Queenstown is a nice resort with nice lake views, but it’s located a 15-minute drive from the town center, and I would probably prefer to stay in town in the future (much easier to get around, and the town itself is very nice). I was going to stay at the Holiday Inn Express, which is a churning favorite, but ended up going with the Hilton due to the credits.

## Trip summary

### Australia

We arrived in Sydney on Friday morning and spent two nights exploring the city. I was unfortunately sick for most of this time, so we didn’t do as much as we could have, but we enjoyed doing the Bondi to Bronte beach coastal walk, getting Asian food in Chinatown (I liked both Chat Thai and Mamak, and thought Mother Chu’s was just alright), taking the ferry, and walking around the harbor.

In Port Douglas, we booked a tour with Wavelength Reef Cruises and spent the day snorkeling a few sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The reef was beautiful (there was very little bleaching), the water was relatively warm, and we saw a lot of fish. The boat ride out to the reef was extremely choppy, though, which I enjoyed (it’s a little bit like being on a very long roller coaster), but P2 did not. It was also a bit cold on the boat, especially after getting out of the water. Overall I had a very good experience, and I’m glad I was able to visit the GBR before it disappears forever, but if I could choose, I would probably snorkel somewhere more accessible at a warmer time of the year in the future.

All the food in Port Douglas was bad, except for this Thai place called Thai Douglas that has a 4.8 on Google - for some reason, the curry and the drunken noodles we ordered were quite good, and I would be very happy to order it in NYC. Anyone staying in Port Douglas should roughly only be eating here.

### New Zealand

We then flew from Cairns to Christchurch, rented a car, and drove from Christchurch to Queenstown over the next few days (zigzagging across the island). We watched tiny penguins return from the ocean in Oamaru (P2’s favorite part of the trip), hiked the Hooker Valley track in Mt Cook, soaked in wood-fired hot tubs in Omarama, and rode the Skyline Gondola in Queenstown. We also booked a Milford sound “coach-cruise-fly” tour through Glenorchy Air, although our scenic flight back was canceled due to weather, and we had to take the bus back.

The scenery was beautiful - the entire island is like 5 national parks glued together, and it’s an insane feeling to be driving through the snow-capped mountains of the Southern Alps on one day and then taking a cruise through Milford Sound on the next. Queenstown is also a really cool place - it’s a small town next to a lake, surrounded by mountains on all sides, with plenty of scenery and good food (Fergburger, Chur’s fish and chips).

If I were to do it again, I would probably just fly into Queenstown and drive from there (Christchurch/the east coast is probably the least scenic part of the island). I would also like to hike the Milford track, since Fiordlands NP was probably my favorite part of the island, although this is probably a bit more difficult/would require more planning.

In Auckland we only had a day or so before our flight back, so we went to the Auckland zoo, where we saw more penguins, a kea, some kiwis (which were very cute) and some other cool birds. Auckland is a bit dead (we went out for dinner at 8pm, and the streets were completely empty), but I would like to explore the rest of the North Island a bit if I were to return.

Overall I was very happy with this trip. I would like to return to Sydney at some point and spend more time in Australia, although I would probably skip the GBR on the second time around, and I would definitely like to return to Queenstown.
