Hi, I'm Harrison! I currently work as a quantitative trader. I majored in CS + Stats at UC San Diego.

This website is my attempt to collect everything I have to show for my hobbies and put them in one place. 

Other than the things here, I also enjoy reading, watching smash, and playing basketball.
